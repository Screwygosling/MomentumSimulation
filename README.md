# About Physics Simulation: Elastic Collisions
This was made in a day so it may not be good but I just wanted to try making a physics simulation thing cause I thought it would be cool to make one and to test myself.

# Features
- Elastic collision between two objects
- input fields for mass and initial velocity of the objects
- Real-time simulation with bouncing
- Simple graphical representation using Java Swing

  # How to Run
  1. Clone or download the repository
  2. Open the project in an IDE
  3. Run the main class (or GamePanel depending on your setup)
  4. Input mass and velocity of objects (I recommend less than or equal to 10 for the mass as larger inputs may break         the program)
  5. Look at the cool moving boxes! :O
